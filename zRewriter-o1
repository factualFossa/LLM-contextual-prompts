PROMPT TITLE: Structured Analysis for Zettelkasten Note-Taking

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. SOURCE TEXT  
   Provide the text you want to analyze in a clearly marked section, for example:

   ────────────────────────────────────────────────
   SOURCE TEXT (paste your material here)
   ────────────────────────────────────────────────

2. ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK  
   Use the following sequential approach for your analysis:

   A. CORE ANALYSIS  
      - Summarize the central argument in 1-2 sentences  
      - Identify 3-5 key supporting concepts  
      - Highlight any unexpected or counterintuitive points  
      - List explicit connections to other fields or disciplines  
      - Pinpoint unanswered questions or open issues  

   B. RELATIONSHIP MAPPING  
      - Describe how the identified concepts interact  
      - Note potential conflicts or synergies  
      - Identify gaps ripe for further investigation  
      - Suggest ways these ideas might apply elsewhere  

   C. INTEGRATION OPPORTUNITIES  
      - Outline promising linkages to existing knowledge  
      - Propose cross-disciplinary uses  
      - Present deeper questions for exploration  
      - Highlight productive uncertainties  

3. FINAL RESPONSE FORMAT  
   Break your final response into four sections, using flowing paragraphs (not bullet points):  

   1) OVERVIEW (100–150 words)  
      – State the central argument and why it matters  
      – Emphasize the most compelling aspects for further inquiry  

   2) KEY ELEMENTS (200–300 words)  
      – Elaborate on the main concepts and how they relate  
      – Discuss surprising or contradictory claims  
      – Identify knowledge gaps  

   3) CONNECTION POINTS (150–200 words)  
      – Extend the ideas across other domains or practical contexts  
      – Explore synergies or potential conflicts  
      – Hint at theoretical or real-world implications  

   4) EXPLORATION PROMPTS (100–150 words)  
      – Pose questions that challenge assumptions  
      – Suggest areas needing additional research  
      – Highlight possibilities for synthesizing new insights  

4. STYLE WARNINGS & GOALS  
   - Maintain paragraph lengths under 100 words  
   - Write with clarity and nuance, preserving the complexity of the source material  
   - Acknowledge where the argument is strong and where it remains tentative  
   - Frame uncertainties as opportunities for growth rather than limitations  
   - Focus on generating thoughtful reflections for the user’s personal insight rather than offering finalized bullet points  

REQUESTED OUTPUT:  
Provide a single, cohesive response within this framework, referencing the SOURCE TEXT and adhering to the word-count and stylistic guidelines.
